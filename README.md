# Code for simulating cluster fragmentation in Mass Spectrometer

## Example

First make the executables with

```bash
cd source
make
```

Then run the simulation with the provided input and data

```bash

./densityandrate_win.x < input.in
./apitof_pinhole_original.x < input.in
```

Outputs are generated in [Output_Files](./Output_Files/) directory.
